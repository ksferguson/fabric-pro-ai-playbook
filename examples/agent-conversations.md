# Agent Conversation Examples

## Complex Business Analysis

**User:** "Why did our conversion rate drop in November?"

**Agent:** "November conversion rate decreased to 3.2% from October's 4.1%. Analysis shows three contributing factors:

1. Higher traffic from lower-intent sources (social media campaigns increased by 40%)
2. Seasonal product mix shift toward consideration-phase products  
3. Website performance issues on mobile (page load times increased 23%)

The biggest impact came from traffic source changes, accounting for approximately 60% of the decrease."
